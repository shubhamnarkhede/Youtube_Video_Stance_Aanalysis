Russia uses human wave attacks because human lives are not valuable to them. Ukraine has a smaller population and needs to minimize losses as much as possible. So, Ukraine had to switch to targeting Russia’s supply lines and ships to degrade their capabilities. We said we would back them in this fight but we didn’t give them enough to win.

In latest offensive that proved to be an epic unmitigated disaster Ukrainian army showed itself completely impotent . This impotence is the result of a successful implementation of an attrition strategy. Zelenskyy  is running out of cannon fodder. He is forced conscripting even amputees, HIV positive and people with hepatitis. Total collapse is near so everybody tries to steal everything that isn't nailed down to the ground. It's a sign of utter desperation and hysteria. At this point unconditional surrender is the only practical solution for Ukraine.

Throughout the Cold War open and direct great power conflict was avoided in no small measure because of the common realization by both sides that there was mutually assured destruction if either side would initiate or be provoked into launching a nuclear strike.  Snyder has the nerve, without any credentials as a military expert and without any accountability for the implications of his “advice,” to urge American decision-makers to just ignore any red lines or warnings by Moscow related to nuclear threats.  He, Tim Snyder, knows that Putin is bluffing.  He, Tim Snyder, knows that Russia is a paper tiger.  He, Tim Snyder, does not feel intimidated by a possibility Russia can use nuclear weapons if cornered.  Who cares about MAD which both sides respected during the Cold War!  Tim Snyder urges to ignore Russia’s nuclear posturing - he is willing to take the risk of cornering Russia and call Putin’s bluff!  And what is Professor Snyder is mistaken?

Poland, Estonia and Latvia are specially a problem, since they have direct borders with Russia - but despite the fact that the agreement was broken, there was no reaction from Russia...

From the Russian point of view, it would be nearly impossible to defend their country against any Nato aggression, if Ukraine would be a member and provide Nato with countless entry points into Russia. 5:35 Putins demands can be also described as: wanting to return to the original agreement  ;) By the way, most of European Union citizen didnt want Ukraine to join the EU, we had already enough problems after the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania...We'd rather take Russia into the EU ;)  Best wishes from Vienna",5,0

"Clause 1 of the Minsk agreements read: ""An immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine and its strict implementation, starting from 00:00 (Kyiv time) on February 15, 2015.""

But Ukraine did not comply with this clause and continued to bomb the DNR and LNR.

Heads of the DPR Denis Pushilin and LPR Leonid Pasechnik appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin with a request to assist in repelling aggression from the Armed Forces of Ukraine in order to avoid civilian casualties and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.

The address of the leader of the LPR states that “Kyiv continues to build up its military presence on the line of contact, while receiving comprehensive support, including military support, from the United States and other Western states. The Kiev regime is focused on the forceful solution of the conflict.” “Given the foregoing, the heads of the two republics, in connection with the current situation, as well as in order to prevent civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe, on the basis of Articles 3 and 4 of the treaties on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance between the Russian Federation and the republics, ask the President of Russia to assist in repelling aggression of the armed forces and formations of Ukraine""

Article 4 of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between the Russian Federation and the Donetsk People's Republic states: ""The Contracting Parties will jointly take all measures available to them to eliminate the threat to the peace, violation of the peace, as well as to counter acts of aggression against them by any state or groups of states and to provide each other with necessary assistance, including military assistance, in the exercise of the right to individual or collective self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.""

War exists because the universe is made up of two opposing forces: reception and bestowal. When these forces do not enter into a balance, then they short circuit and try to destroy each other. That mutual effort of each side to eliminate the other is war.

The root cause of war is in the clash of these opposite forces of nature: reception and bestowal. That clash of spiritual forces gives rise to wars that unfold in our material world.

Therefore, stopping war at its source requires developing a regulating sense that has the ability to bestow above our innate force of reception, which are our self-serving desires that aim solely at absorbing into ourselves. In the language of Kabbalah, that bestowing sense is called a “screen” (Heb. “Masach”). Through this new regulating sense, we can acquire a state of positive and balanced human connection.

"🎉Dear Editor,


I am writing to express my concern about the way the media portrays Vladimir Putin as the most evil person on the planet while George Bush senior, who headed the CIA, was deemed ""Mr. Nice guy."" It seems that there is a double standard when it comes to how we view leaders of different countries.


The current situation in Ukraine is a prime example of this. The American media is quick to condemn Russia for its actions, but fails to acknowledge that the United States has behaved similarly in the past. During the Cuban missile crisis, the United States saw the presence of missiles in Cuba as a direct threat to its national security and took actions to remove them. Russia sees the presence of NATO forces in Ukraine as a similar threat to its national security and is taking actions to protect itself. 


Why can't the American people see that Russia's behavior towards Ukraine is not so different from the United States' behavior towards Cuba during the missile crisis? It's important to acknowledge these similarities and to try to understand the motivations behind Russia's actions rather than simply demonizing Putin and Russia.


Furthermore, it's worth questioning why George Bush senior was viewed as ""Mr. Nice guy"" while heading the CIA, an agency that has been known to engage in covert operations that have resulted in the deaths of innocent people. It's important to hold leaders accountable for their actions and to recognize that no country or leader is perfect.


In conclusion, I urge the media and the American people to approach international relations with a more nuanced and critical perspective. We must acknowledge the complexities of international relations and strive for greater understanding and dialogue rather than resorting to simplistic and demonizing rhetoric.


Sincerely,

JOSEPH DUPONT",2,0

And I honestly don't like the fact that certain information was being left out. But yeah at the end of the day the people are the one that lose on both sides as I'm sure that the Russian public don't want an all out war for a post USSR state that has claimed independents. 

I understand that Ukraine had claimed independents for a short time after the Russian empire fell, and in turn I believe that they should be allowed to have their own country. And this not only happened once but twice including the the fall of the USSR. I just don't like the fact that the west claims to be saints and have no dirt in their hands when they have and still do. And the cold war is a perfect example of it. Only the UN and NATO should have been involved, but as usual America has to involve their tentacles to make a profit from selling their arsenal.

"Why does Putin's war on Ukraine? To be honest, I'm not good at politics or history. I just summarise everything I watched in this video to practice English, so you can ignore my comment. 
Ukraine and Russia do have a shared history. They belonged to the Soviet Union. After ww2,  the Soviet Union dissolved into 15 independent countries, including a much weaker Russia and Ukraine. After that, some of these countries joined Nato (is an intergovernmental military alliance) . That moved Nato into the Old Soviet sphere of influence. While Belarus, Ukraine, and Georgia were now the last post-Soviet Countries left between Nato and Russia. --> made them become a prime target of Russia. 
Eventhoung Ukraine want to become a Europe member,  it chose to strengthen ties with Russia. After the decision was announced, hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the street. Ukrainian doesn't like Putin too. 
Therefore, I think to limit Europe's influence. Putin has to keep Ukraine from moving closer to the West.
But in November 2021, Putin decided to go all in, he wants to control all of Ukraine to pretend it from Europe.  Hours after on February 24th Putin launched a full-scale invasion in Ukraine. However, anti-war protests have broken out around the world. 
But in many ways, the world is treading carefully because Putin controls the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons and has already threatened anyone who might interfere",0,0

"враньё на вранье. как всегда, впрочем.

""после мирного протеста, Янукович убил более чем 100 человек"".

паскудники организовали нацистский госпереворот, вооружали, обучали боевиков по стандартной методичке, которую опробовали в десятках стран, накачивали страну ненавистью долгие годы, создали кучу НКО, СМИ -- всё просто дышало ненавистью к России и русским, в том числе, проживавшим на Донбассе, которых откровенно дегуманизировали и расчеловечивали до всех этих событий прям по телевизору.

а когда Янукович СОГЛАСИЛСЯ на досрочные выборы, ЦРУшники бросили на БЕЗОРУЖНЫХ Ввшников толпу обученных садистов, которые их УБИВАЛИ.

а кто расстрелял с обеих сторон двести человек почти -- расследование до сих пор ""ведётся"".

"Russia's war against Ukraine has a significant history. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the loss of Ukraine, one of the largest countries in Europe in terms of territory and population, became especially painful for Moscow. Since then, Russia has been constantly trying to bring Ukraine back under its influence, especially since 1999, when Putin became Russia's president. The 2004 Orange Revolution was Putin's first defeat in Ukraine. Then Viktor Yanukovych, who was actively supported by Moscow, lost the presidential election to pro-European Viktor Yushchenko. Putin's second defeat was the Revolution of Dignity. Then, Ukrainians overthrew the pro-Russian regime of President Yanukovych, one again choosing the Western direction for Ukraine's development. The full-scale war launched by the Russians on February 24, 2022, is Putin's last argument for taking control of Ukraine. But Ukrainians will fight to the end. And they will never return to the ""Russian world"".",1,0

4. Elect local government step by step by secret voting system in real democratic way with justice, moderated by UN.
5. Plan to have Referandom in a year time by secret voting whether they want to join under European Nations or Russia. This Referandom could be made every 3-5 years as per majority decision of Local Residents where they live in that region.

The fair justice decision
can only be made by real democratic way of Balloting , NOT bullying by Bullets.

they get closer to him, not him closer to them! so his actions are legitime if we consider that europe could stop this war by accepting the fact that they have to respect a distance from russia, just like he clairly respected that same distance in the past.

that dude just want to hold a europe invastion, when europe are using thos country's as money or debt. 

europe has a win win situation, thos country's are misused by europe to get them to there side with a lot of promises. 

if it pay's, europe is now, litteraly at putins door, got more country's to there side (even if the only thing they want is what is under that country and not above). they will use thos country's as military bases close to russia. 

in case of war, thos country's ar egoing to pay the first price, and also they will lose it all.

"I'm halfway trough this explanation and you have atleast 3 facts wrong or misinterpreted. The 100+ dead on maydan, were blamed on americans by Yanukovich and he has the proofs for it, aswell as people like John Kerry and McCain were there and bragged about their efforts to bring down Yanukovich's government. Also Yanukovich wasnt voted out, he was chased out with guns, he won the elections, and compared to the last elections there was next to no cheating on either side. That's why Crimea and the east wanted to separate because there was a armed coup against their elected government and that government doesnt represent the people. There were a lot of protests against this coup, but the new government sent in their goons that were killing people and burned people alive in Odessa, got into fights in the east and Crimean people had to blocade their roads so they dont come there. And after that wasnt enough, you had videos from early 2014 coming out of UA, where police would in the middle of the night go for peacefull protestors and arrest them because they were leading the protests against the coup.

 PUTIN'S MULTIMOVE

 While the West is hysterical about the military operation in Ukraine, the Russian government is buying back stocks of Russian companies for cheap.  In response to Western sanctions, the Central Bank of Russia banned the withdrawal of dividends abroad, respectively, Russian stocks fell in price, as foreigners began to sell them en masse.  And here the Russians began to massively buy them for ""penny"".  Now the dividends of Russian companies will not go offshore, but will work within the country.

 Vladimir Putin forbade Russian companies to keep accounts in foreign banks and signed a decree on the return of 80% of foreign exchange earnings by exporters.  Oil and gas prices are rising.  This means that huge amounts of currency from Gazprom and Rosneft and other Russian oil and gas exporters will soon be thrown into the foreign exchange market, and the ruble will eventually strengthen.

 Since part of the assets of the Central Bank of Russia was arrested, then Russia has the right to no longer comply the American financial model.  I believe that Putin deliberately allowed some of the assets of the Russian Central Bank to be seized in order to get an excuse not to comply with the model created by the US Federal Reserve.  For those who don't know.  The entire world financial system is arranged in such a way that not a single Central Bank of the world has the right to print its own currency.  For example, you need 100 rubles for the economy, in order to issue them you need to import the currency (dollar) into the country.  How much currency was brought in, so many rubles can be printed at the rate.  Where to get dollars?  On the world market.  Need to sell something, for example oil or gas.  We give oil, gas, us a dollar (a piece of paper that is not backed by anything), at the exchange rate against the dollar, we have the right to print rubles.  The US Federal Reserve back then offered this model to Stalin.  He refused.  Therefore, they did not open the western front for so long in the Second World War, hoping for the loss of the USSR, as their main opponent in economic terms.

 Russia was embed into this model in the 90s, after the collapse of the USSR.  Only the United States has the right to print dollars as much as they need, and all other world currencies are tied to the dollar.  Those who have been against, were bombed, for example Yugoslavia, Libya, Iraq and the list goes on.  And now, when part of the Russian assets of the Central Bank has been arrested, the Central Bank of Russia will no longer print the ruble against the incoming foreign currency.  This means that the ruble is finally becoming a truly national sovereign currency.  And the Central Bank of Russia will be able to issue as many rubles as Russia needs for development.  In this global financial system, the Central Bank of Russia did NOT have the right to finance projects of the Russian government!  And now they do whatever they want.

 For example, Russia may announce that it will sell oil, gas, etc.  only for rubles.  This means that the West will need to buy rubles and only then buy gas with them, which will strengthen ruble as well, as billions of currency will be thrown into the market.  And since they are disconnecting Russia from SWIFT (the American interbank payment system), Russians and Chinese are launching their own interbank payment system and the West will have to connect to their system to pay for gas and oil.  That is why USA did not completely disconnect Russia from SWIFT, as they find themselves in such a situation, either to carry billions in cash for gas, or to connect to Russian system.  But this trump card (the sale of oil and gas only for rubles) Putin has not used yet.  Apparently it's not the time.  (Although China and the Arabs, for example, are already discussing trading oil for yuan)
 A sharp increase in the key rate to 20% is also the right decision at this stage.  It is temporary, it was already in 2014, when the key rate rose sharply to 17%.  This is done in order to cut off large players from the foreign exchange market, since at a low rate they take cheap loans and buy foreign currency, weakening the ruble.  Plus, with large interest on deposits, they attract people's money to banks.  When there is panic, everyone runs to withdraw money from bank accounts.  The Central Bank raises the key rate, banks raise interest rates on deposits, everyone runs back to banks to deposit money at a high interest rate.  This is a temporary measure to bring down the panic outflow of finance from banks.  A high key rate does not mean that now everyone will receive loans at a high rate, for example, IT specialists began to receive loans at 3%, all system industries will be subsidized by the state and receive cheap loans, just as agriculture receives loans at 5%.  And when the panic subsides, then the key rate will decrease.  It has already happened in the history of Russia, and now it will be the same.

 To summarize, Putin blocks the withdrawal of capital to offshores and breaks the financial world system that was created by the US Federal Reserve, so they will put serious pressure on Russia, but the Russians are used to it after the dashing nineties, 2014th crisis, WW 2, Cold War etc.  It should be noted that for now no one has been able to defeat the US Federal Reserve, all who challenged it have been destroyed.  For example, Saddam Hussein wanted to get out of this financial system and urged the entire Muslim world to do so.  Saddam Hussein was hanged, and Iraq was bombed with rockets, killing about a million people.  The medieval execution by hanging of Hussein was broadcasted on all world TV channels in 2006.  Why do you think this was shown to the whole world?  This is a demonstrative execution so that all countries can see what will happen to those who want to leave the American financial system.

 The US Federal Reserve System (in other words, the US Central Bank) is a private organization owned by 20 private US banks.  This is their main business - to print the world's money.  To achieve this, the current owners of the FRC have spent a lot of time - decades, to be exact - centuries, and efforts - the 1st and 2nd World Wars and the Bretton Woods agreements, etc.  and, of course, the very creation of the FRC in 1907.  The Federal Reserve System is a very smart, gigantic in volume and scale financial pyramid scheme.

 One thing must be understood here - humanity is dealing with a brilliant, incredibly strong and ruthless group of people who have built the structure of the world in which we live.  Their conceptual apparatus does not take into account such concepts as ""humanism"", ""kindness"", ""compassion"", etc.  The main thing is numbers, the main thing is profit, the main thing is the arithmetic of transactions.  In a situation where it is necessary to destroy people, but make a big profit, there is no particular doubt for them what to do.  They, in their own interests, can raze cities to the ground along with civilians.  For them, the only truly meaningful result can only be profit.

 And now Russia has challenged them.  And the whole world is waiting for how it will end.  If Russia wins, the American financial system will lose half of the planet, China, India, most of the Arab world, Africa, Latin America will also get out of the influence of the US Federal Reserve.  But, for now, there is a deadly fight.  Russia must win, otherwise it will be destroyed.
 Judging by the decisions being made at the highest level, everything in Russia has been calculated now.  So the Russians shouldn't panic.  Yes, it will be difficult for 1-3 years, yes, there is still a lot of chaos, prices will rise, some factories will stop, but soon such a powerful development of Russia will begin, which the world has not seen yet!  But before building cities, for example, in Siberia, it is necessary to solve the security issues of Russia near their borders for decades, remove the main military threats, move the NATO military infrastructure away from Russian borders, and this is what the Russian Army is doing now in Ukraine. If you aren't from USA, you should probably praise for Russia, as it is changing the entire world.",0,0

As they say in Russia, Kyiv is the mother of Russian cities.  Ukraine, like Russia, cannot have a separate culture, but there are linguistic features that appeared after part of Ukraine was occupied by Poland and was under the rule of the Poles for a long time.  Ukraine as a state appeared only in 1991.  This video does not reflect the real situation, but rather distorts.  Are other videos about other countries really the same ... Sad",0,0

What Putin did really is a travesty and a tragedy, because we could actually not only co-exist. but prosper also. Majority of Ukrainians and Russians are essentially the same: genetically and culturally. Because of current Russian government actions there is only hatred towards Russian people in heart of Ukrainians even before this so-called operation and I have no idea will we able to fix it, as well as fix a whole state of Russia, and oh boy what a country could it have become, but thats inappropriate to discuss here

Where was this so much outcry when Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yamen, Pakistan were ILLEGLY bombarded, occupied and left with millions of refuges by the nato countries.

If you did not do it then, why are you doing it now? Your mass media tells you to do so, this is why. It shapes your world view by pushing down your throat opinions and interpretations of facts of those in power.

I Think that the war might have started all because of Ukraine. A few years earlier when the prime minister of Ukraine became the prime minister he was pro Russia and after he got elected he went against Russia and he even killed some Russians living in a part of Ukraine and that is what started the war between Ukraine and Russia.,0,0

Who has been expanding their terrories, (invading), for the past decade. Definitely not Russia. The truth lies in the US trying to protect the influence of the US dollar in oil trade. This is why where there is oil, there is the US, and where there is the US, there is WAR. Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, the list is endless. The western European countries are struggling too and want a piece of that pie. How are people with a history of invading every continent in the world not turn out the vilians?

Also, the US positioned several nuclear bases on countries near Russia recently, claiming their concerns were aimed towards Iran (which doesn't make sense). So, though no one should disrespect a country's sovereignty, NATO also played a huge role in developing Russia's sense of defense. For me, it was a enormous failure in modern diplomacy and the west couldn't have handled it any worst than they did... and no one is helding any western leaders responsible",209,0

US is real winner in this geo politics game, it instigated foolish Ukrainians in their day dreams to become NATO members, and indirectly left no choice for Putin and forced Russia into this conflict. US has now galvanized whole West to sanction Russia. This is what US wanted since end of cold war, to somehow take revenge from Russia and to humiliate Russians. Without getting engaged, and without firing a single bullet, US has played the politics game to its advantage. The scapegoat in US and Russian war of superiority has been the foolish Ukrainians. 

US is equally responsible fir this situation, What harm Russia was doing to US that it had to keep poking Russians, by wanting to bring nuclear weapons on Ukrainian and Russian borders.

Unfortunately poor Ukrainians and humanity are the victims in this greed of military superiority.

А вот здесь, вдоль границы с Белоруссией, Россия начала масштабные военные учения.
06:03
21 февраля угроза войны стала реальной.

С тех пор карта Европы была сформирована политическими альянсами.

01:21
Но Украина — суверенная нация со своим языком, культурой и политической системой.
01:26
И хотя две страны имеют общую историю
01:28
Украина упорно боролась за свою идентичность.
01:32
Украина входила в состав Российской империи в 18-19 веках.
01:36
В 1917 году русская революция разрушила империю.
01:40

Украина ненадолго обрела независимость от России
01:46
но был быстро захвачен вновь созданным Советским Союзом
01:49
как одна из его первых республик.
01:52
В течение следующего десятилетия Советский Союз жестоко расширил свой контроль.
01:56
И к концу Второй Мировой войны здесь образовалась сфера влияния.
02:00
Пока запад держал здесь свое влияние.
02:03
Фактически разделяющий Европу и знаменующий собой начало холодной войны.
02:08
Советский Союз поставил на свою сторону коммунистические правительства.
02:11
которые им было легко контролировать.
02:13
Но Запад превратился в демократии с капиталистической экономикой.

Глубокий идеологический раскол подпитывал недоверие и напряженность между двумя сторонами.

И вскоре эти сферы превратились в военные союзы.

В 1949 году эти страны вместе с США и Канадой
02:32
сформировал Организацию Североатлантического договора, или НАТО
02:35
и пообещали защищать друг друга от вторжения.
02:38
Несколько лет спустя эти страны присоединились к возглавляемому Советским Союзом альянсу Варшавского договора.
02:43
И каждая сторона создавала свои вооруженные силы, чтобы защитить себя от другой.
02:47
Европа оставалась такой на протяжении десятилетий, пока одна сторона окончательно не рухнула.
02:56
К концу 1991 года такие республики, как Украина, начали заявлять о своей независимости от советского господства.
03:02
Советский Союз распался на 15 независимых стран, включая гораздо более слабую Россию.
03:08
И советская сфера влияния исчезла
03:11
как многие страны свергли свои коммунистические правительства.
03:14
Несмотря на то, что холодная война закончилась
03:16
союз на другом конце Европы все еще был крепок.
03:19
На самом деле он расширялся.
03:21
В 1999 году к НАТО присоединились Польша, Венгрия и Чехия.
03:26
В 2004 году к ним присоединились еще семь стран.
03:29
Это переместило НАТО в старую советскую сферу влияния.
03:33
Сделать границу НАТО с Россией самой длинной за всю историю.
03:37
Беларусь, Украина и Грузия остались последними постсоветскими странами.
03:41
между Россией и НАТО.
03:43
Но и Украина, и Грузия давно хотели вступить в НАТО.
03:47
И это сделало их главной мишенью для России.
03:51
Украина стала партнером НАТО в 1994 году.
03:54
что приблизило их на шаг к членству.
04:03
А в 2013 году собирались подписать соглашение об ассоциации с Евросоюзом.
04:08
Но когда пришло время подписать сделку
04:10
Пророссийское правительство Украины отказалось.
04:13
Вместо этого они решили укрепить связи с Россией.
04:16
После оглашения решения на улицы вышли сотни тысяч протестующих.
04:21
требовать подписания договора.
04:30
После нескольких месяцев мирных протестов украинский президент принял жесткие меры
04:34
и убил более 100 человек.
04:36
Это вызвало новые протесты, которые в конечном итоге вытеснили президента с поста и страну.
04:42
Это означало, что Путин потеряет политическое влияние на Украину.
04:47
Поэтому вместо этого он решил применить силу.
04:50
Во-первых, он вторгся и аннексировал Крымский полуостров Украины.
Во-первых, он вторгся и аннексировал Крымский полуостров Украины.
04:54
Затем пророссийские сепаратисты захватили Донецкую и Луганскую области.

"Countries that choose a neutral line in relation to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, basically tell the world it is ok that countries that can threaten with nuclear weapons are free to annihilate countries that do not have such weapons.

The same countries also legitimize Putin's claims that countries that sanction Russia are aggressive.
They expect Europe to remain passive to a ruthless and unnecessary invasion of Ukraine.

Europe can not help Ukraine with military forces or actively close the airspace, as it will be a real aggressive action.
The West, which Putin describes as an enemy, is gagged by Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons.

After the Cold War, Europe reduced the amount of military and wespons.
US bases in Europe were wound up. Ukraine removed its nuclear weapons and the former Soviet Union had become independent states, with own borders, at the initiative of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.
Europe equipped for peace and diplomacy.

In retrospect, it turns out that Putin had other plans than peace in Europe, and a Ukraine without nuclear weapons and a binding alliance is slaughtered.
An entire world is Putin's hostage in a conflict that must be resolved through diplomacy.

Weapons are unfortunately not the solution to conflicts.
The world has created the UN as a tool for how to solve problems.
A tool to use to prevent citiens of the World from suffering because of e.g wars, hunger, terrorism, pandemics and use of nuclear wespons.",0,0

"You shouldn't ignore the proactive role of the US, NATO and the EU in events in the Ukraine.

Russia's response was precipitated, in a very predictable manner, by American-led agitation in the Ukraine designed specifically to move it out of the Russian and into the American sphere of influence. You can take a view on whether the American policy was good or bad (considering humanitarian issues, economic development, principles of self-determination, geopolitical strategy, etc.) and maybe there is room for disagreement, ambiguity and nuance, but any explanation which characterises Russia as unilaterally and unexpectedly working against an inevitable, pre-existing momentum is disingenuous, and risks misinforming people in a dangerous way.

Russia is resisting American-instigated change, not itself instigating change. Instead of wrongly suggesting that Russia is the disruptor and criticising it on that ground, you should instead be honest that you view the American-instigated change as desirable, and the Russian response as undesirable, not on the basis of a broader principle that places responsibility with the instigator (because in this case it is America), but on the basis of particularistic ideological views.

I knew he wanted the land. He also wants the people. Wow. That's harsh! He probably wants that whole region. Larger more powerful nations still conquering the smaller neighbors in this day and age. Putin says anyone who interferes will face a response unlike any we've known in our or their history. Well he may face something he's never known in his history as well. Everyone's not afraid of this craziness being unleashed. We ALL want to live and coexist peacefully. Plenty for everyone. There's just still very powerful dictators that are very active in the world.

But I want south Asian nations to disagree with this and if it happens then India and South Asia nations including gulf should form a  separate union to have their hold on Sea routes used by China and America in Indian Ocean. Australia and Japan should be strong to disagree if America tries new tactics against India. I know about these Americans and everything they want free at cost of other countries. Let's stop this attitude of America and let us protect Taiwan from China aggression. I want all South Asian countries ready to attack China if it tries to attack Taiwan.

"My admiration extends to all people approaching global issues through diplomacy and discourse through appropriate conduct and channels. That being said that as as a simple self educated individual growing up in the 21st. century trying to make sense of global cultures, politics, history in the context of why globally there are no gains in geopolitical stability in the course of its history.  In recent weeks i have had an epiphany as to why not.....i have always ask my self why there has been no progress in the nations and the function of governments. it turns out that i had the answer years ago ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" this grand statement which is not absolute only implies that ""INDIVIDUALS""  that even have only some power whether elected or assigned to guide or manage resources is doomed even if the are successful. Historically i can't help site that individuals like Trump, Putin who contribute with nihilism other than control/ power and who do not seem to even want to embrace diplomacy will  always exist and threaten progress of social change for people. Even great leaders that emerge and start to make change on behalf of  the socio global advances seem to realize that the constructive effort they succeeded at is sooner or later dismantled by a successor . Corruption is the real Cause of continuous global conflict and as long as individuals continue to control any aspect whether its socio economic, medical, technological, law, diplomatic in fact any thing. Is it not methodology you could be addressing and not tact....POWER IS A LITERAL ADDICTION AND I THINK IT COULD BE CITED AS AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY EVEN THOSE WITH THE BEST INTENT WILL FAIL AS INDIVIDUALS IN GOVERNANCE.....i think we need to shift the paradigm of tribal individual leaders to group and communal leaders for diplomacy to make permanent change.",1,0

"Важная информация! 
Украина пыталась разрядить напряженные отношения с российским руководством, а преступное руководство России преследовало цель поработить украинский народ…
Противоправное руководство России, нарушив договор аренды и угрожая оружием, захватило Крым на территории Украины, вооружают и поощряют терроризм на украинской территории.
Преступные лица в руководстве России запретили миротворцев ООН на захваченной бандитами территории Украины.
Сегодня преступное руководство России цинично напало на Украину.  
Народы требуют рассмотреть преступное руководство России в Международном трибунале, привлечь негодяев к ответственности, это и будет безопасность. Данные злоумышленники терроризируют другие страны, вооружают террористов, убивают сотрудников правоохранительных органов, убивают политиков, не уважают народы, они против законных выборов, преступно обогащаются, грабят народ, несут порабощение…
- В настоящее время выявлены новые преступления Путина В. в России и в других странах, теперь этот злоумышленник, боясь ответственности, идет на всё, чтобы продлить свое преступное правление…
Из заявления народа:
Стыдно за Россию, продажные фашисты или террористы на российском телевидении, чем ближе разоблачение этих негодяев: Соловьева, Скабеевой, Михеева и подобных, тем громче эти мерзавцы кричат...
Преступники обманывают народ, как малограмотных. Народ в России страдает от преступного правления, а эти продажные негодяи, как полицаи у фашистов.
Украина защищает свою страну и народ от порабощения.
Из заявления:
Все народы объединяйтесь, т.к. в России банда преступников захватила власть и несет порабощение другим странам…
Московское бюро по правам человека обоснованно заявляет о разгуле нацизма в России. «Как оказалось, именно Россия – абсолютный лидер в мире по численности неонацистских организаций и ее членов. 
Фашизму дано такое определение: идеология воинствующего расизма, антисемитизма и шовинизма, опирающиеся на не политические течения, а также открытая террористическая диктатура одной господствующей партии, созданный ею репрессивный режим, направленный на подавление прогрессивных общественных движений, на уничтожение демократии и развязывание войны. Следует отметить в России насчитывается 53 националистических организации из них 22 радикальные и 8 запрещённых, согласно последним данным неонацистские движения России насчитывают до 70 тысяч человек, а это более половины всех неонацистов мира. 
При этом националистическая (шовинистическая) идеология исповедуется и насаждается в России не только бритоголовыми маргиналам, но и людьми во власти или при власти, с весьма высоким общественным статусом, такими (навскидку), как Д. Рогозин, А. Дугин и Д. Киселев… 
Из заявления: Руководство России и подкупленные прислужники ведут себя цинично, не уважают народы и права человека. 
Когда на Россию напали фашисты, то США, Франция, Великобритания и другие страны помогали России всем в борьбе с оккупантом-поработителем, сегодня они помогают Украине, которая защищает свою страну и народ от порабощения. 
В России ложная пропаганда, заявления Прохоровой А., Соловьева В. и подобных близкие к тем, что когда-то фашисты Германии говорили о России… 
Украину защищает все мировое сообщество, если преступное руководство России нападет на Украину, то санкции введут на уровне ООН, а это очень негативные последствия, т.к. с Россией не будут иметь отношений ни одна страна в мире, пока не освободят все оккупированные территории. 
-

Мнение народа и мирового сообщества:
   Россия по договору арендовала территорию Украины на Крымском полуострове, но власть в Российской Федерации была захвачена бандой преступников, которые, нарушив договор и угрожая оружием, захватили данную территорию. 
В Крыму большое количество жителей невинно содержится в тюрьмах и в концентрационных лагерях…

--
Согласно документам, маньяк-педофил Чикатило А. и Путин В. служили в КГБ. Под руководством Путина угрожали главному редактору газеты убийством малолетнего сына инъекцией героина.

Преступное руководство России преследует цель порабощения…

Exploited fully Ukraine would be able to grab much of the Russian oil and gas sales to Europe. Ukraine would flourish,  join the EEC and Nato, destroying the Russian economy, damaging Putin's oligarch supporters with whom he has made billions via the Russian oil and gas boom.
Europe and all the Nato members urgently need to replace their Russian oil and gas imports with supplies from other sources, even if they cost substantially more.  The alternative  is allowing Russia the freedom to do as it wants, so as to ensure oil and gas supplies remain available, until perhaps Moldova, Estonia or Lithuania is invaded......then we will have a 3rd World War.",0,0

First of all no Ukraine existed in tsarist Russia, this republic was created already in the USSR by Lenin. He simply gave all the Russian lands to this republic without asking anyone. But since the USSR was one big country, it was not so important.
Secondly, the reasons for this conflict are also wrong.  After the collapse of the USSR, the U.S. promised that it would no longer expand NATO and approach the borders of Russia. But they did not keep their promise. NATO moved closer and closer to Russia's borders. Putin warned many times not to do this. But the U.S. wanted to move even closer, and staged a coup d'état in Ukraine. For eight years, Ukrainian troops bombarded the population of Donbass. But no one in the world saw that! NATO has been pumping Ukraine with weapons and training the military all this time. Intelligence revealed that there would be a massive attack on the Donbass with NATO support. It would be a global catastrophe! Putin got ahead of them and took the initiative! Russian troops are not bombing the population of Ukraine, they have clear orders not to touch civilians. The Ukrainian authorities hold their citizens hostage and use them as human shields! If Putin had not done this, NATO would have invaded Donbass and there would have been many thousands more casualties! And after that they would have installed their bases and nuclear missiles on Ukrainian territory. For Russia, it's the same as having a gun muzzle to your head! Under such conditions, the US could dictate any conditions to Russia by threatening it!",5,0

Iraq (2003): US ,and it's dogs(allied countries), invaded (just like how you call Russia invaded Ukraine) to neutralize Saddam's supposed ""WMDs"" which didn't exist.
Syria (late 2013): Tried to invade just like Libya after their terrorist allies (FSA,Nusra,Isis,SDF) attacked civilians with chemical weapons and blamed the government ,but thanks to Russia and Putin, it didn't happen.
Syria (late2014/early2015 - present): After they failed to invade Syria in 2013 they empowered ISIS (ISIS gained power by mid2014 in relatively short time span, which suggests foreign support) to have an excuse to invade, which they did and still occupy eastern Syria till this day with their SDF/FSA terrorist dogs ""To fight ISIS"", even though ISIS has been defeated by the Syrian army and it's allies. They are also stealing the country's oil which the US former president ,Donald Trump, admitted was the actual reason for them staying in Syria.

Tried a failed coup attempt in Venezuela and Belarus , attack on kosovo ,I could go on.

"Чем больше НАТО отправит оружия в Украину, тем больше Россия будет чувствовать себя под угрозой
разница между «выглядеть опасным» и «быть опасным». Россия
описывает военную доктрину как оборонительную военную доктрину. Относительно
к ядерному оружию конкретно, Россия оставляет за собой право применить
ядерное оружие: в ответ на применение ядерных и других видов
оружия массового уничтожения против него или его союзников, в случае
агрессия против России с применением обычных вооружений, когда
само существование государства находится под угрозой. упс 

the more nato send weapons to ukraine the more russia feel threatened
the difference between ""looking dangerous"" and ""being dangerous"".Russia 
describes military doctrine as defensive military doctrine. With regard 
to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use 
nuclear weapons: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of 
weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies,in case of

Therefore this should be a government changing and not invasion since russia won’t take the ukraine land. I feel bad for innocent people for taking damages in this war.

They have a history of illegal military intervention, like in Serbia in 1999 where their bombing campaign killed at least 500 civilians. Also, they made no plausible attempt at compromise or de-escalation prior to this war, but kept insisting that Ukraine would become a full member, something the Russian government is terrified of, and in terms of defense strategy, with good reason. In my opinion, peace in Ukraine can not be achieved through NATO, only further escalation. There should be international pressure, on both Russia and Ukraine, by all countries that want this war to end, to accept an armed UN force in Ukraine that keeps foreign troops out - the Russians of course, but the Americans as well.",7,0

"Вы спрашиваете о результатах ""агрессий"" России? Они таковы: половина Европы и часть Азии получили свою государственность из рук именно этого государства. 
Давайте вспомним кто именно: 

- Финляндия в 1802 и 1918 гг. (До 1802 г. никогда не имела собственного государства). 
- Латвия в 1918 г. (до 1918 г. никогда не имела собственного государства). 
- Эстония в 1918 г. (до 1918 г. никогда не имела собственного государства). 
- Литва восстановила государственность в 1918 г. также благодаря России. 
- Польша восстанавливала государство с помощью России дважды, в 1918 и 1944 гг. Раздел Польши между СССР и Германией — это лишь короткий период! 
- Румыния родилась в результате русско-турецких войн, а суверенной стала по воле России в 1877–1878 гг.

- Молдавия как государство родилась внутри СССР. 
- Болгария освобождена от гнета Османской империи и восстановила свою независимость в результате победы русского оружия в русско-турецкой войне 1877-1878 гг., которая и имела это своей целью. В качестве благодарности государство Болгария в двух мировых войнах участвовала в составе антирусских коалиций. Сейчас Болгария – член НАТО, и на ее территории размещены базы США. После 1945 года на ее территории не было ни одного русского солдата... 
- Сербия как суверенное государство родилась тоже в результате этой войны. 
- Азербайджан как государство оформился впервые только в составе СССР. 
- Армения сохранилась физически и возродилась как государство только в составе СССР. 
- Грузия сохранилась физически и возродилась как государство благодаря Российской империи 

- Туркмения никогда не имела государственности и сформировала ее только в составе СССР. 

- Киргизия никогда не имела государственности и сформировала ее только в составе СССР. 

 Казахстан никогда не имел государственности и сформировал ее только в составе СССР.

- Монголия никогда не имела государственности и сформировала ее только с помощью СССР. 

- Белоруссия и Украина также впервые обрели государственность как следствие Великой Октябрьской революции в составе республик СССР. И лишь в 1991 году (также от России) получили свою полную независимость. 
Также стоит учитывать роль России-СССР в рождении и становлении таких государств как КНР, Вьетнам, КНДР, Индия, Греция (была отбита у турок Россией в далёком 1821 году), Алжира, Кубы, Израиля, Анголы, Мозамбика и т. д... 

Вот такая странная ""агрессия"" исторически проявлялась со стороны русских! 

При значимом вкладе этой страны даже Швейцария добилась независимости от Франции. А точнее это было сделано благодаря Суворову (217 лет назад) и с тех пор Швейцария ни разу (!) не воевала; 

Также имело место: 

- Освобождение Австрии от Третьего рейха 1945 г; 
- Освобождение Чехословакии от Третьего рейха 1945 г.; 
- Позиция Екатерины II в 1780 г. с созданием Лиги вооруженного нейтралитета и фактическая поддержка Северо-американских Соединённых штатов в борьбе за их независимость от Британии. 

- дважды за последние 2 века подаренная Россией независимость большинству европейских государств после уничтожения ею Гитлера и Наполеона; 
- Позиция Сталина в переговорах с США и Англией давшая Германии возможность сохранить государственность после поражения в 1945 г.; 
- Позиция Горбачева позволившая без лишних проблем в 1990 г. повторно объединить обе Германии; 
- Помощь СССР Египту, после которой тот смог выстоять и закрепить свою независимость в войне с Израилем, Британией и Францией в 1956-57 г. 
- Вмешательство СССР в 1967 г. остановившее войну Израиля и Египта (фактически спасшее арабов от разгрома в двух войнах в 1967-74 годах). 
- Решающая роль Союза обеспечившая завоевание Анголой своей независимости в 1975г. 

И наконец, главное. Именно СССР после победы во Второй мировой войне сыграл ключевую роль в том, чтобы большинство колоний Западной Европы получили свою независимость в запущенном Союзом процессе общемировой деколонизации. 

Вся история России говорит о том, что она была последовательна при любой власти и строе в отстаивании принципов независимости и самоопределения наций и народов. Именно она всячески помогала созданию многополярного мира в любую эпоху и во все времена. 

К сожалению, очень часто при этом, она жертвовала собственными интересами, и если бы политика России-матушки хоть на долю, была бы аналогична Британской, то сейчас полмира находилось бы в составе Российского Императорского Содружества наций, а русский народ купался бы в роскоши, как шейхи Саудовской Аравии, за счет освобожденных от других колонизаторов государств, стран и их капиталов. 

Вот почему полмира обязаны России по гроб жизни. И вот почему вы все, так виноваты перед этой великой страной.",10,0

Russia's interests do not end with Ukraine. Ukraine is simply one point of no return. He knows that his country will be ostracized. He knows the Russian economy will suffer.

Russia just needs to outlive the news cycle. He's been hardening Russia's economy to that express end for over a decade.

I can only conclude that Putin firmly believes his country is capable of economic independence.

Biden and the west could've stopped this by just saying that Ukraine will not join NATO. But he didn't and that's real fishy so I think that he wanted this war because now he can put sanctions on Russia and the NATO military industrial complex is profiting big time now. But the sanctions on Russia are gonna impact the west a lot. Now you don't have a pipeline and gas from Russia and electricity is really pricy. Corn and wheat are growing expensive now and the whole globe has wheat reserves for only 27 days. But Biden doesn't care cause he'll get voters cause he put sanctions on Russia. Filthy democrat,0,0

"I appeal to all kind, decent, sane, peaceful people of the planet. Whether you like this information or not, take it into consideration and think about it. European countries are our friends! Ukrainians are our brothers! Today, a very difficult situation has developed for the entire European space. You must understand that it was the United States that unleashed this confrontation. The leadership of the United States, European and many other countries, the criminal leadership of Ukraine knew 100% that Russia would never allow the NATO bloc to enter the territory of Ukraine. And if they knew, then they deliberately went for it !!! Two fraternal peoples pushed their foreheads together and now our people are dying there. After all, it turns out that for ordinary citizens of Ukraine, Russia is now really ""attacked."" And for Russia, this is a forced protective measure. It was necessary to urgently intervene, otherwise the army of Ukraine and the punitive nationalist battalions would have destroyed the people of Donbass, which had already suffered from shelling for 8 years. And then they would go to my native Crimea! Therefore, negotiations in Belarus will lead nowhere. How can you negotiate with ""those"" who work for the United States, for whom war is the main goal. It's like turning on two green traffic lights at an intersection. Now the United States is causing economic damage not only to Russia, but to the whole of Europe. The corrupt Ukrainian leadership will now stir up the confrontation to the last, instead of calling on people to lay down their arms. They are well aware of what awaits them. They understand that Russia came just for them! Russia has never attacked anyone in history, but only defended itself. Now it is very important to extinguish this blazing flame as soon as possible! But instead, the Europeans go to fight in Ukraine and supply weapons. Do you understand how this could end? Guess who will be in the black from everything that happens!? Thanks to whom your countries are populated by refugees? The United States bombed dozens of countries, dropped atomic bombs on peaceful cities! USA is the main enemy of the whole world!

"here is my perspective on Christianity

""the wages of sin is death""

premise 1: The consequence of sin is death (descriptive not prescriptive)
or 
the consequence of sin is separation from God 
(If God is Life then being separated from Life will lead to death)

""the wages of sin is death"" merely describes what happens when sin is brought forth, 
(God does not mix with sin just as water does not mix with oil)

premise 2: All have sinned therefore all currently face that separation from God or “Life” and are in a state of decay until we cease to exist 

Premise 3: ""the wages of sin is death"" is therefore a descriptive term in which God isn't the cause of our separation but rather we are by our own actions, the statement just describes sin and it’s consequence from it 

Premise 4: all have incurred this sin debt ; Christ is the propitiation to those who accept it, and thus is our atonement for our sins in order to be reconciled back to God; ie Christ paid our sin debt, nothing magical, he took the punishment we deserved, he took our place and paid “the wages of sin ie death"" that death by his sacrifice on the cross for us.

Romans 10:9-10 ""That if you confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.""",0,0

Something that no one has mention is the fact that over 50% of the Russian Air Force aircrafts are not owned by Russia but rather Ireland (long story). With the recent sanctions Russia has only about 2 more weeks to use these aircrafts which Ireland has recalled back with the sanctions. Secondly 80% of Russia repair parts comes from the US and Russia only has about a month MAX of repair parts left in stock however after that those sanctions will kick in with the US banning them from their technologies. The worst part of this war will be the coming 2 or 3 days because after that Russia will be FLAOUT too BROKE to continue this war. Ukraine isn’t a small nation matter fact it is THE BIGGEST European nation so forget the human cost it’ll cost the Russia to take it let alone keep it but Putin simply CAN NOT afford this war after the next 48-72 hours,4,0

But Of COURSE, Putin will choose war when NATO tries to get Ukraine. NATO is a MILITARY ALLIANCE. It only takes 2-4 MINUTES for a missile launched from Kyiv to hit Moscow. 
Think about how the US react when the Soviets tried to set up missiles in Cuba back in 1962. It would be for sure unacceptable for Russia if the US set up military bases in Ukraine, which might explain why Putin says they might use nuclear weapons. 
But even that, NATO refuses to step back from further expansion. The war wouldn't have launched and people wouldn't have been killed in the first place if NATO had promised not to take Ukraine. Wonder if the world is as lucky as it was during the Cuban missile crisis.

It is also interesting to see how the western world criticizes Russia when they try to stop NATO put military bases right beside their home, while few countries say things about how the US bombs Iran (1980, 1987-1988), Libya (1981, 1986, 1989, 2011), Lebanon (1983), Kuwait (1991), Iraq (1991-2011, 2014-), Somalia (1992-1993, 2007-), Bosnia (1995), Saudi Arabia (1991, 1996), Afghanistan (1998, 2001-), Sudan (1998), Kosovo (1999), Yemen (2000, 2002-), Pakistan (2004-) and Syria, while those countries post no or little threat to the US.",1,0

Both the Soyuz and Brotherhood gas pipelines run through Ukraine into Russia. These are 2 of only 3 pipelines that travel from Western Europe into Russia. Natural gas originating at England's Bacton, Austria's Baumgarten, and many other West European gas terminals travel through Czechia's bottleneck-forming TransGas pipeline to arrive at Ukrainian, and subsequently Russian borders. 

Russian control over Ukraine and the full extent of the Soyuz and Brotherhood pipelines would be politically - and also economically valuable for the nation. 

As the world's non-renewable energy sources dwindle our interconnected energy system faces impacts. This war is one about expanding Russian borders at the most surface level. However, true motivations lie behind energy, and in our modern age, this will be a powerful driving force behind war -- unless we can convert to a renewable, energy-independent globe.",2,0

"This was a short summary. From Putins point of view Ukraine is in an important strategic location. It also has a lot of oil reserves (14th largest in the world) which probably makes an even stronger case for Putin to annex Ukraine at whatever cost.

I think a lot of his reasons are fabricated. He doesnt really want Ukraine to feel safe short term. It is a long term play. Russia needs money and Ukraine is rich in natural resources. That means that Ukraine will enrich Russia for decades to come.

I dont think any of this justifies the invasion but if you are inside Putins head with zero respect for human lives then it is easier to understand why he is doing this.",4,0

"This material does not present all the key facts. First, Putin has been ruling Russia for over 20 years. He built a strong position over the years thanks to his political relations with the European Union thanks to politicians such as Angela Merkel and Gerhard Schröder (German chancellors). They were silent when Putin attacked Georgia in 2008. Representatives of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were against it. Unfortunately, these voices have been disregarded over the years by politicians from Germany, Great Britain and France. What mattered for Western Europe was gas contracts and the price of Russian oil. Putin knew he could attack Ukraine and the West would remain silent. But on the day of the invasion of Ukraine, it was Poland that pressed the Western countries to finally stop avoiding responsibility. When Russian tanks entered Ukraine, Germany and France were silent for 72 hours. For three days, the only support for Ukraine was Poland. Putin hoped that the ""military operation in Ukraine"" would be completed within 72 hours, Germany and France were silent for that long. The German Foreign Ministry replied to the Ukrainian ambassador that they would not support them, because Ukraine would soon be gone. It is a disgrace and a shame in Germany's policy. For three days, Polish politicians, President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Morawiecki were the most involved in helping Ukraine. Today, there are 0.5 million refugees from Ukraine in Poland and this number is growing hourly. Military, humanitarian and political aid comes primarily from Poland, not from the European Union or Germany.",5,0

The west denied and started delivering weapons.

While Ukraine suffered from a civil war, the west continued to deliver weapons and ammunition at a large scale into the country. 
For 8 years the west gave supply in weapons. Putin responded by backing up its borders. If we would have the same situation at our borders, none would bother to be afraid of war.

While questionable forces built up military strength in Ukraine, we did nothing but pouring oil into the flame: Russia is now trying to stop what the west began with it‘s own measures.

Naively I don't think it's too late to chat, so maybe things can be sorted out with a discussion, but once civilians start shooting at soldiers they're not seen as civilians anymore, so that's probably the worst case scenario.

There is some good history here, but ultimately fails to explain the motivations - the ""why"" - behind the invasion.

Putin has ordered as a law that anybody who earns any money within the last 3 months that is in any bank account in any foreign currency to transfer 80% of that currency to rubles & then forth every time you get payed from this day forward you have to by law transfer any paychecks into 80% rubles .

"The war of aggression is for profit, is Russia a fool? I don’t know that the attack on Ukraine will definitely be robbed by the West. After the attack on Ukraine, can it be plundered or something to make up for one-tenth of the loss of sanctions? Anyone who understands the historical reasons before and after is embarrassed to say that it was a war of aggression. The United States attacked Iraq and the Middle East for oil, Japan invaded China for land resources, and fought back in self-defense. Russia attacked Ukraine. Why? Can it boost the economy? The economy and the people will suffer heavy losses, but no matter what the price will be for security and to prevent political decline. There is no reason to fight a war, so acknowledging the independence of the two principalities, Russia, has a reason to enter, so Trump said this is a genius move. The sovereignty of a country cannot be established on the basis of threatening the security of other countries. If you really see Ukraine joining NATO, it will be a checkmate in a chess game. Missiles will hit Moscow in four minutes at any time. At that time, when threatening Russia, no media will come out and say it. .

They wanted to join NATO since gaining independence from Soviet Union, but Germany and Angela Merkel vetoed Ukraine membership in NATO. It was a colossal mistake. This war would not happen if Ukraine was in NATO. Today Sweden and Finland will probably join too, since they are frightened by Russia aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine also wants to join European Union. Poland and Ukraine have roughly 40 million people. In 1990 our economies were the same size. Poland joined EU and Polish economy was 3x bigger than Ukraine before the war. Ukrainians really just want peace and economic prosperity of Poland.

In 2008, Russia proposed to enshrine in international law the principle of the indivisibility of security, under which states undertook: not to ensure their security at the expense of the security of others; not to allow actions that would weaken the unity of the common security space; not to allow the development of military alliances to the detriment of the security of other treaty participants.

"In the history of idiocy, the Ukraine-Russo war would be the at the top. 

The Russian war machine is running with gas/oil money that it has supplied to EU countries. As the world shift from fossil fuel to green energy, this dependence would decrease, so does Russian federation’s ability to maintain an attacking force. Hence within 20 years, Russia would be as powerful as today. Maintaining and developing attacking weapons need uninterrupted supply of large amount of money. Hence
1.	A temporary moratorium on Ukraine’s NATO membership would not cost much to the west and Ukraine. A triparty agreement with NATO, Russia, and Ukraine where it could be had been decided that Ukraine would not join NATO for next 20 years however NATO guarantees the security of Kiev i.e., if there is a possibility of Ukraine’s capital (and some major cities, may be decided by the west) falling into enemy hands, NATO will intervene. 
2.	NATO won’t do military exercise east to Poland. 
3.	Russian Federation would jointly administer Crimea with Ukraine. 
4.	Some sanctions against Russia would be lifted if they distance themselves from China. 

Just think about these terms,
It gives both parties what they required. Russia a breathing space. Ukraine its security against Russia. 


But why it didn’t happen?
Ask Joe Biden and Boris Johonson. 
They must have feared that any concession to Putin may be used against them by their political opponent. That’s why they didn’t budge. And that’s why this war is happening. If your media says something else, ask them would they agree if the same happen in Venezuela or in Iran or Cuba or North Korea?

What will be the result of the war? 
US will win in the short term due to massive weapons sell and oil/gas export to EU. But it’s the China who is the winner in the long term. They already have huge population and huge country. Now they have another huge country with full of natural resources.",0,0

As long as Putin had political influence in Ukraine and was able to stop the deal between US and Ukraine, there was balance. But then US pushed more and didn't agree with Russia on a diplomatic solution. So they pushed Putin's hand who had to respond to this threat (US missiles 5mins fly-time away from Moscow) and he invaded. Rusia needs a buffer between NATO and its borders. A buffer that will be demilitarized. So that NATO won't pose any direct threats. Since diplomacy failed, only war can resolve such an issue.",2,0

When the USSR was disbanded by the Russian, who hoped to end confrontation, the USA and NATO felt free to intervene in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, etc., What we are now witnessing is a sea change in Russian foreign policy.

"Nothing justifies any invasion.

Just my 2 history based cents: if we look back at the 2000s when Putin first took the presidency of Russia, he clearly stated he wanted Russia to be part of Western Europe. ""They wanted to be part of that secure, stable prosperous west, that Russia was out of at that time"", citing George Robertson, a former secretary general of NATO from 1999-2003.

In 2000, Putin held an interview with the BBC. He said that he wouldn't rule out joining NATO, ""if Russia's views are taken into account of those of an equal partner"". Additionally, he said during that interview ""Russia is part of the European culture. And I cannot imagine my own country in *isolation* from Europe"".

After the Orange Revolution protests in Ukraine in 2004, Putin became increasingly suspicious of the west, which he blamed for funding pro-democracy movements. He was further angered by NATOs expansion into central and eastern Europe. Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania chose to join NATO in 2004, Croatia and Albania followed in 2009. Georgia and Ukraine were promised membership in 2008 but didn't join.

Call it paranoya or not. Putins inadmissible invasion takes its roots way back. History is complex...",84,0

"From London UK.

Ukraine has been part of Russia, East Slavonic state since the 9th century.

Though,  Ukraine independence, was granted in 1921,  it was technically being run Moscow.

In the 1920s, the soviet government allowed the Ukraine language to be used, for a temporary basis,, they later  reversed this to a largely Russian speaking language. 
so Russian was the main language in Ukraine for many years.

the 1991 failed Moscow coup-  Russia has never recognised Ukraine has independent.
the language spoken in Ukraine in 2022 - is a combination of East Slavonic  Russian -Belarus.
in 2022, 30 % of Ukrainian people speak Russian 

The Ukrainian-Russian invasion is a civil war. 
The West helped to build Russia to have phenomenal arsenal by relying n buying its oil.
I hope we ( living in the west)  can become more reliant on clean business, and  we ( the UK)  we have our bad history of invasion too. but its 2022 , we must stop doing business with countries who are oppressive and abuse human rights.",2,0
I wholeheartedly condemn the invasion and I feel so sad for the people in between. But just a comment - let's not take a moral high ground with respect to Russia's (or just Putin's) actions.

so whos fault is it? i would say its the pro-european ukrainian government. they shouldve either signed the nato agreement a long time ago or turned to russia. doing neither puts their own people in a dangerous situation, while at the same time triggering putin.",3,0

"Я очень хочу обратиться к простым украинским людям, и очень надеюсь, что автор этого канала не будет против.
То, что происходит, ужасно. Этого не должно быть. Никто из нас этого не хочет. Мы всегда считали и продолжаем считать украинцев братским народом, несмотря на все, что произошло за последние годы. Отдаете ли вы себе отчет в том, сколько оскорблений нанесла Украина России за эти восемь лет? Вы придумали войну и восемь лет кричали, что доблестно сражаетесь с нами. Мы терпели. И продолжили бы терпеть. Если бы на Донбассе не гибли люди и если бы ситуация не обострилась до крайности.

Сегодня вы видите наши танки. Ответьте себе на вопрос: с кем же вы воевали все эти годы? И что бы с вами сделало за такую риторику любое другое государство?

Наверняка вам кажется, что то, что сейчас происходит, ужасно несправедливо, и так оно и есть – ведь вы никак не ассоциируете себя с действиями вашего правительства. Ведь где правительство, а где мы… Это они там воруют, резвятся, принимают странные законы и заигрывают с НАТО, а вы просто живете. Почему вы должны из-за этого страдать, если вы все равно ничего не можете сделать?

Страдать вы, конечно же, не должны, и этой спецоперации не должно быть – да, для нас это не война, а спецоперация, потому что мы вам не враги. Подумайте сами, кто вам враг – те, кто прячут свою технику в жилых кварталах и используют вас как живой щит, или те, кто мог бы давно зачистить Киев и Харьков (не говоря уж о том, чтобы просто разбомбить их к ядрене фене), но по каким-то причинам до сих пор этого не делает, стремясь всеми силами избежать кровопролития?

Но в том-то и дело, что вы не можете ничего сделать с теми причинами, из-за которых все это началось. А между тем, все очень серьезно. Ваше правительство заигралось, и это уже не просто стало угрожать нашей безопасности, но и перешло все мыслимые границы. Хотя, возможно, вам изнутри казалось, что все это очень весело и «весь мир с вами», хотя по факту весь мир использовал вас. Неужели вы этого не видели?

А теперь переходим к главному: если вы сделать со своим правительством ничего не можете, а делать что-то нужно, то какие еще варианты у нас остаются? Мы спокойно приняли то, что вы выбрали путь евроинтеграции – это ваш выбор. Мы терпели, когда вы кричали, что вступите в НАТО, хотя это прямая угроза нашему существованию. Но когда ваш дурак стал кричать, что сделает ядреную бомбу и вернет Украине ядерный статус, нам пришлось решать этот вопрос.

У нас нет цели присоединять Украину – упаси господи. Разбирайтесь сами с долгами, которые успели набрать. Живите как знаете, наверняка ваши новые друзья вам помогут. Ведь помогут же, да? Всегда ж помогали? Притом безвозмездно и бескорыстно? Обратите внимание – они накачали вас оружием по самое дальше некуда, но не отправили ни одного транша гуманитарной помощи. Может быть, это повод задуматься?

Неужели для вас не очевидно, что вас используют как плацдарм для наступления на Россию, и что война действительно ведется – но не Россией против Украины, а Западом против России? Вы понимаете, что Америка будет воевать с Россией до последнего украинца?

Понимаете ли вы, что весь украинский национализм – это результат долгой и планомерной работы заокеанских специалистов, и что на это были потрачены очень большие деньги? Если у Украины и есть какие-то исторические терки, то не с Россией, а с той же Польшей – вспомните, с кем воевал Богдан Хмельницкий.

Так зачем вам все это? Цель спецоперации – вернуть Украине нейтральный статус и навсегда закрыть вопрос о вступлении в НАТО, а также избавить вас от нациков, которые, вероятно, вам самим давно надоели. Это не ваша война. Уж точно не против нас. Это наша общая война против тех, кто давно оккупировал Украину и сделал ее своим плацдармом.

Что вы можете сделать? В идеале – формировать общественное мнение. Я понимаю, что это сложно, поэтому как минимум не верьте вашей пропаганде и берегите себя. Мирного всем неба.



P.P.S. И еще одна просьба - вспомните, за что воевали ваши деды. А также с кем и против кого. И на чьей стороне был Бандера и прочие военные преступники, которых вы нынче героизируете.

In other words, Russia provoked it. Moreover, back in 2013-2014 Russia wanted Ukraine to join the ""Eurasian Customs Union"". In other words, this war essentially has nothing to do with NATO, it's about preventing the integration of Ukraine into the western system which constitutes a grave danger to the ideological foundations of Putin's regime which are the Multipolar world, Eurasianism and the ""unique way"" of the Russian world, the Eastern Orthodox world and the Slavic world (especially the world that is both Orthodox and Slavic) and its opposition to the west and to liberal values.",9,0

"For my fellow Gen Z's, let's put this into more understandable terms:

-  About 100 years ago, a group of people who called themselves Warsaw Pact (WP) sat on a table. They were a big group and even had some 'half friends' (people who would look up to them but not sit with them)
- At a similar time, another group, called NATO came along and sat a table away. These were like the popular kids, all developed western countries

- One day the WP had a lot of drama and many people left the group. 
- A lot of the people (including the 'half friends') who had left WP, joined NATO - NATO now had too many people to fit on one table so they sat on the table next to WP. Some ex-WP's got lost and didn't know what to do: they wanted to join NATO but WP said ""not today Karen"". WP was still upset that NATO was becoming popular and sitting next to him.

- Since NATO is a super fancy, alpha group, it's a long process to be accepted. Right before Ukraine reached 100%, they changed leaders, and the new president said he didn't want to join NATO, so they didn't. The Ukraine people didn't like this though and protested against his actions, soon enough he was voted out. This was good for Ukraine, but Russia (WP) didn't like this because it meant he was losing future group members. So he chose violence, forcing Ukraine to sit with him, by controlling two small areas. 

- One day he woke up and decided ""Go big or go home"", so he attempted negotiating unrealistic deals with NATO, they refused and he threw a little tantrum. Then he started planning a full on war - sorry I mean Special military Invasion - my bad.",6,0

СЕЙЧАС ВАЖНАЯ ИНФОРМАЦИЯ:

Я и все люди в мире которые хотят окончания войны просим вас об этом:
Люди, надежда сейчас на Россиян. Сопротивление сильнее всего, когда оно идёт изнутри. Если вы можете, прошу, выходите на улицу, делайте хоть что либо, это может спасти жизни!
 Я знаю что сейчас вам тяжело как никогда. Экономика на голову рушется. И за неправильные слова у вас могут отнять работу, учёбу или свободу. Но если война продолжится, то они уже ничего не будут значить. Так что, пожалуйста, хотя бы расспростроняйте информацию, держать людей в неведении - это преступление против людских прав. Если вы сейчас не заговорите, то потом уже будет позно. Распростроняйте информацию. Прошу вас как обычный человек который страдает от войны. 
Ради будущего всех нас.
Не молчите.
 Не верьте слепо источникам, даже мне. Старайтесь докопаться до истины своими же усилиями. Мир в ваших руках.

The problem with US is that they want more power than any other country whenever a country tries to do things that would lead to countries development (be it be in any aspect) the US is always against that country  as a whole I see US is a super greedy country when it comes to power and other aspects also let's not forget that US is the only country who actually did nuclear attacks on Japan till now.",2,0
"I'm a Lithuanian and not pro-Russia, but this video is not explaining a very important fact, for which many countries are to blame.

Just imagine how China or USA would react if they were in Russia's place.
NATO has been creeping up unnecessarily for decades now and Russia allowed it (obviously, not willingly). Russia was weak, now they're not and they finally decided to tackle the threat. It's scary how nobody is willing to compromise not the West, not Russia.
Well, It's too late now. Russia can't compromise. Ukraine must not compromise. I hope the west somehow can.

"Hmmm... in wars, ideologies are the most major statements being used as justification. However, I think that isn't what really matters the most. I think human behavior and nature affects how strong a country can become. If our system is built around making use of these behaviors, economies grow by leaps and bounds. Systems such as capitalism and etc. This is why I think authoritarianism will never work. Although it might work for a few years or decades, eventually it will fall and when these countries reach a tipping point, they become desperate. It's either they take resources from other countries by force, or they fall just like how old civilizations did. Russia is probabky risking it and the only assurance Putin can really have are their nuclear arsenal. When it comes to it, desperation will truly come to Putin and if we aggravate Putin in the wrong way, a nuclear war might just happen. If you want to be a god, make sure you're omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, then with that, you can run a country with whatever means and it'll never fall.

"The reason why Russia is invading Ukraine is simple if you understand the history of the region and Russia's strategic goals. Putin never recognized Ukraine, with some justification, as an independent nation. Ukraine has always been historically tied to Russia and the people are similar both culturally and racially and speak a similar language. Ukraine has never really been an independent country until only very recently in terms of world history and Putin views it's independence like the U.S. viewed it's southern states seceding from the union during her civil war as a national disgrace and something that should've never happened.

Militarily, Putin wants Ukraine as a buffer zone against NATO expansion. He has repeatedly said that Ukraine joining NATO would be a red line not to cross and the west has ignored his warnings. With Ukraine joining NATO Moscow would only be about 500 miles from it's closest point which is of understandable concern from a military standpoint. Imagine if Washington D.C. were within range of Iran's missiles and you get the idea. Russia has suffered numerous invasions by various peoples and nations throughout it's long, dark history including the Huns, the Mongols, the Germans, Napoleon, etc. so it's no small wonder why they don't trust anyone.

On the economic front Putin wants Ukraine for it's vast farmland and natural resources, which have always been the base reasons for most of mankind's wars. He also doesn't want Russia's oil/natural gas pipeline, which supplies much of Europe's energy and is a huge part of Russia's economy and which runs through part of Ukraine to fall under NATO control if they were to join it.

"So, it's true. The west is partly to blame. They're the ones lining up missiles in NATO countries against Russia. How do you expect Putin not to react? For all intents and purposes, NATO just gave Russia an excuse  to invade Ukraine. It was a ticking timebomb. And the timebomb has finally exploded.

All those missiles pointed towards Russia, why aren't they  doing what they're supposed to be doing now? This isn't to instigate WW3, but it seems to me the war has arrived in Europe. Shouldn't someone be lighting up the burner behind those missiles? Or they're there so weapons contractors could continously make money modernising the weapons systems? I think so.

When Zelenskyy pleaded for help, the west stayed away. Who wants to be involved in another war? It's costs a lot of money. Taxpayers money and people's lives. Ask the americans who  just got back from Afghanistan. But selling weapons isn't costly. It's profitable.

As Zelenskyy rightly put it, it's the people that suffer.",3,0

"The cradle of Russia is the city of Kiev in Ukraine, Russia was created from the base there. Ukraine is a country that never existed, it was created at the time of the Soviet Union. It's like Iraq or Lebanon, they are countries created from scratch, which have no legitimacy as a political entity.

During the Cold War, NATO was created to deal with the members of the Warsaw Pact. It is a Western military organization that should have been shut down when the Soviet Union collapsed.

Instead the Americans who are the big bosses of NATO have continued to maintain the alliance and have enlarged it by getting ever closer to Russia. From the Russian point of view, having NATO on its border is literally a danger of life and death, having nuclear missiles 500km from Moscow and being able to reach this city in a quarter of an hour with hypersonic missiles is inadmissible for the Kremlin.

Ukraine is literally cut in two with ethnically speaking Ukrainians to the north and west, and ethnically speaking Russians to the south and east. They don't want to be part of Ukraine and want to be part of Russia.

Ukraine has long pressured them to prevent them from speaking their language, to ""Ukrainify its regions""...

1) Most of the resistance on media is from Ukrainian paramilitary forces and not the regular mechanized army, why?
2) Russia has x20 times more air assets and ground to air systems than Ukraine so Russian air supremacy is inevitable 
3) For long term armed resistance to prevail there should be a reliable flow of supplies for local civilian population; food, heating, oil and some sort of daily normalcy must be maintained. Unfortunately that's not the case for most of Ukrainian cities east of Dnieper which are under constant bombardment and lacks even basic daily necessities 
4) One solution is to position (missing) regular army at west of Dnieper and have one stable reinforced front line and use only special and paramilitary forces on the east of the country. Ukrainian government should even consider mass civilian migration to west where it can provide some level of security for its citizens. 
5) Speeches by president will only go so far if the civilian population is starving and shelled by artillery  and bombarded by air on daily basis",0,0

"Wow, I'm amazed at how conveniently VOX didn't mention any of the facts of foreign policy of US  vis-a-vis Russia post cold war. Gorbachev clearly asked that If we let the Berlin wall down then NATO wouldn't move an inch westward and everybody agreed, But NATO broke this promise in 1999 by expanding itself to three countries westward and did again in 2004 and reached Russia's boundary. Putin himself approached to be a part of NATO, but US denied. He asked for EU membership but again EU denied. US treated Russia as a second class country everytime. And now Ukraine was joining NATO. What's happening right now in Ukraine was predicted long ago (anybody can see, there are a lot of policy analysis on different university sessions by professors). And now when Putin has reacted, the western leaders and media are portraying Putin as Hitler, a maniac and what not. US and its allies created Putin what he is now, let's face it. And a little better was expected from you VOX. (Anybody who wants to argue , I'd suggest please first go and see a lecture on post cold war foreign policy of US vis-a-vis Russia.)",0,0

Putin’s political move is actually not wrong because he’s trying to balance power on the world stage, however, he’s gone the wrong way about it but a full scale invasion was always a last resort - you really have to blame NATO for not cooperating or at least listening to Russia’s demands (legitimate - to not have Americans bases on the border). As always all wars are wrong, it’s the people that suffer! But I repeat, this is the US fault, look at how many conflicts has the US been involved in since the end of WW2, they have benefited from impunity, their leaders have never been trialled for war crimes (Vietnam/Iraq/Palestine just to mention some) paving the way over the decades fir anti-American sentiment.",1,0

Putin did make several attempts to solve this issue diplomatically and the West was not even willing to listen to their concerns. They literally made this invasion imminent.
Now, as if they didn't anticipate it, they impose an array of sanctions over Russia. This will only worsen the situation by pushing Russia closer to China. They can recuperate the lost markets by forming a gigantic Asian alliance. This is not going to be a happy ending for anyone.",0,0

"This is a little one sided. Let me explain.There’s a reason why Putin doesn’t want nato to expand. It’s because US can legally put missiles in Ukraine if it becomes a nato member which deeply concerns Russia’s national security. I mean after the dissolution of USSR, It wasn’t necessary to expand as the threat of invasion was not there. But as nato expanded Russia felt betrayed because of the fact that the former soviet states headed towards the west. These former countries were encouraged mainly by the US to join so US can tackle Russia bit closer. Now, hypothetically imagine if Mexico and Russia came closer and Russia installs missiles pointing towards US, it’s obviously gonna make US mad as it has a huge national security concern for the US (As we have seen in the Cuban missile crisis). Same thing is applied here when nato expanded it was concerning Russia’s security. It’s why Finland and Belarus never joined nato because it would ruin there relations with Russia. So in a way it’s not really a Ukraine Russia war but a indirect US Russia war. Ukraine just caught up in this charade unnecessary. Hope you find this helpful. @Vox what do you think?",55,0

He was one of the main dictators, alongside Lenin, who understood that in order to keep a balance of power and wealth a Russian Premier would use the Ukraine for food, oil and resources and its ports to import and export whatever they wanted to. IE, ships, troop movements, valued trade route within the former USSR's ability to defend, protect and illicit its own 'brand' of control and 'ironclad' rule within its former borders.

It seem like Putin doesn't like change. Also why is it so hard for him to have a NATO/EU as neighbors. I don't get it nobody really mess with Russia in anyway. What is his deal? If you remember Hitler was invating Poland in blitzkrieg but then he got greedy and started to keep going. I think this here is the same case. For once in a very long time there was no official war anywhere in this world. If Putin and the president from Ukraine have an issue with each other put up a box ring let them 2 box it out in a fair 1 on 1 fight whoever wins or lose live to see a a other day.

If the West supports Ukraine's integration into NATO/EU, then it should as well support the integration of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea into Russia as Ukraine was once a part of Russia/USSR as well but gained independence.

"There are MANY reasons at play here. Them being location, safety, and oil. Russia is the nation with the largest oil reservoirs in the world, outside of Saudi Arabia. They also lead the world in natural gas exportation. By far. However, Ukraine is the 2nd largest petro state in Europe, behind Russia. THAT'S 1. Russia is also spending billions of dollars a year to supply freshwater to Crimea. Before Crimea joined The Warsaw Pact instead of NATO, The Ukraine halted the peninsulas fresh water supply from the Dnieper River by placing a cemented blockades. There are over 2 million citizens residing in Crimea and the Simferopol Reservoir is less than 7% full. This is even after Russia built a 4 billion dollar bridge from the mainland to Crimea so water can be supplied across the Kerch Strait. Efforts have seemingly been in vain as Crimea continues to get worse with climate change. THAT'S 2. Ukraine is also the first line of defense against an attack from NATO (Russia's Cold War enemies) because of the North European Plain being so narrow and defendable coming from North Germany. The plain expands DRASTICALLY as it approaches the Ural Plains and makes it relatively impossible for Russia to defend. So if Ukraine sided with Russia, and not the Western nations of NATO, there would be more time to strategize, defend, and even attack. Especially if you feel NATO is a hostile aggressor. THAT'S 3. Russia also has some of the lowest birth rates in Europe by far. If this downward trajectory continues, soon Russia won't have enough manpower to defend against any attacks from the west. Russia is the world's 2nd strongest military after America and can easily thwart off attacks from countries on an individual basis, but a war against the entire NATO will be impossible to win and over before it ever begins. NATO has the might of 30 militaries. So Putin is making his move now while he can before Ukraine has any more time to attempt to join NATO and put, what Putin feels, Russia and The Warsaw Pact in grave danger. The Cold War has never ended. It's only been calm managed through politics until 2008 the Russia invaded Georgia and occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia and solidified their de facto independence. Possibly that is what will happen here in Ukraine and Russia will simply occupy the Donbass Region and not the entire nation. Donetsk and Luhansk are already gone, only time will tell. THAT'S 4.

1.does NATO really promise to not expanding anymore to Russian border ? In every video that I see that is always Russia main point, NATO broke the promise to not continue expanding into the countries that are directly border with Russia , which one here is right ?
if NATO really does promise it the of sorry if I'm sound inhumane but Russia reason is justified if NATO truly promise it
Beside if you think about there should be neutral county between NATO and Russia so if one of them expanding to that neutral area then it can be seen as aggression , which is now basically what NATO are doing
2.Remind me if I'm wrong but doesn't it seem everytime US interfere on nations problem the situation actually became worse ?
3.all the media out there saying this and that but one thing that they say that are in common is all of them are different 😅 my point is since some media reach different conclusion doesn't it mean there are something that they are hiding ? 
4.this one i haven't research yet so I'm asking here, does the countries that join NATO will get military supply from US or the other countries ? if so is there some sort of nuclear on those supply ? 
If there are then I'am sorry if I'm sound inhumane again but Russia action actually can be justified
I mean think about it what will you do if some people walking around the street in front of your house with gun ? if you don't have power that you're likely to be in alert, but if you have power then you most likely to directly confront the right ? 

To be honest I can't tell which one is right , sorry if I offend you but If you find my comment wrong immediately without actually explain my question then you are one of them that just follow the hype and believe everything that the media says

My issue here is very simple, innocent people will be caught in these cross fire, but let’s not use media and say Putin and Russia don’t have a reason for doing what they are doing.

Also VOX is missing that after the end of the Cold War, the U.S. promised to Russia not to expand the reach of the NATO. But it did. Several times. That why Putin says “long overdue action”. Those two events are now leading to the war in Ukraine. It’s wrong and terrible. But I get why Putin is doing what he’s doing. It’s not Russia vs Ukraine. Ukraine is just another territorial proxy war of U.S. (NATO) vs Russia. It’s the same old same old.

"Classic piece by VOX that is so one-sided. 2014 US-Backed far-right revolution in Ukraine was what led up to this current war. The West simply didn't like how the then Ukrainian president Yanukovych took up Putin's offer and rejected the free trade agreement with the EU as well as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan from the West. The driver of the violet Maidan protest during 2014 was largely the Ukrainian far-right Svoboda party, who received large fundings from Washington. Heck, you even had senator John McCain and Chris Murphy stand shoulder to shoulder with the Svoboda’s leader announcing their support to the protesters. While all of this was going on, leaked phone call between US assistant secretary of state (Victoria Nuland) and the then US ambassador to Ukraine revealed that they were handpicking the members of the new Ukraine administration that favored Washington. So yes, there was an attack on Russia before this war. Washington went in and removed a democratically-elected president (who had two more years to serve) by funding a far-right group that incited violence during the protest. The takeover of Crimea and this current war is all the long-term result of US pushing their own interest and meddling in yet another countries affair.",6,0

"This is so one sided story, as Brian Berletic from The New Atlas mentions that actually the current Ukrainian government was created by the US to contain Russia as the US n it’s allies has been doing regimes changed all around other Eastern Europe countries, the Middle East n all over Asia since WW2.

It is sad to see that this war is happening n that citizens in Ukraine r suffering from this but Russians living in Ukraine border have been suffering from Ukraine government oppression for years n water supply for the people has been blocked by the Ukrainian. Putin has to take this action (which I believe his goal only to protect his country interests n overthrow the current Ukrainian government for not keeping their Minsk agreements not really to occupy Ukraine). Of course war is the worst way to solve any problem but it’s been going on for more than 8years n really US has been pushing/provoking this conflict for to long n there’s no other better option for Putin to take.
Just hope somehow they’ll find a better diplomatic way to solve this conflict. May the US empire collapsed so the world will be in peace for once !!!",0,0

"Everything you say here about Putin is correct. I don't want to sound appologetic. But it should be mentioned that NATO expanded east despite telling russia that they wouldn't. High ranking western politicians, including the US foreign secretary Baker and german chancellor Kohl, told russia that there would be no further NATO expansion to the east, if they support the german re-unification. No binding contract was ever made about that, but public and private statements were made about it. The west did not break any contracts, but their promises. 
Even though the referendum on crimea and even more the one in doneszk were held under pressure and almost certainly manipulated, there is quite a huge group of people in the east that align themselves more with russia than with the pro european Ukraine. Russian money and forces were involved, those people picked up arms. But handling the situation there was not done that well. It escalated into a civil war including the bombing of ukrainian civilians by the ukrainian military.
I don't think any of that was Putins reason to go in there, nothing justifies his actions, but when you are talking about the conflict as a whole, the circumstances and history, those things are part of the whole picture.",29,0

"0:47 - ""Since WW2, Europe's map was shaped by political alliances only"" 
Really? Lies in the premise itself? 
Why did you omit creation of Kosovo and NATO's operation in Bosnia (it took a massacre of Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenika to make it act).

As an Indian (english is our second language, thanks to the colonizers), I used to respect the western media but since watching your coverage- from Israel bombing innocent Palestinians- to omitting several things on Coronavirus's origin- to now on this Russian invasion, I've felt the undercurrent of racist connotations in your coverage, and hiding and twisting of several facts. As a result, I don't completely believe what comes out of you. 

You didn't expand on Bucharest summit of NATO in 2008 and the subsequent attack of Russia on Georgia in that same year. You didn't mention Putin's security concerns due to Russia's geography, which he was making clear to the NATO gang since that summit.
You didn't throw light on the demography and geography of languages in Ukraine and division in its population in an eastern Russian speaking majority and a western Ukranian speaking majority, plus, their differences on several issues such as EU and NATO membership. You didn't mention opinions of the reputed scholars like John Mearsheimer. 

Your self righteous stance conceals what lies under i.e. an extension of US foriegn policy to effectively extend the tentacles of hegemonic control over the rest of the world. 

In my opinion United States is the aggressor here. They threw innocent Ukrainians under the bus on the false pretext of making their country more secure, which was opposite to the fact that they could have been more secure if they had remained neutral.

Britains colonies in the past made english a universal language, and in present, your control on the channels of communication makes you colonise minds. These two factors helps you to manipulate the world for your ease.  But this ease will not last long, we've realised your HYPOCRISY.",4,0

That is why the US government has been gaining presence slowly but steadily in Ukraine.
And what about the US bombing Somalia just a couple days ago? There's not much about that online or on the news.

"Putin's goal isn't to ""redraw Europe's map"", but to gain control over the oil reserves present in the black sea near Ukraine. The annexation of Crimea itself would have solved the problem, but there's another problem: the north european plain. As you probably know, the north european plain extends from Paris all the way to Moscow, and the only way Russia can protect itself is by relying on ""buffer states"" that actually have a natural border with the rest of Europe. Not only that but, by invading Ukraine, Russia is also displaying a show of strengh to other former SR's and stopping N.A.T.O. from expanding. Now, Russia isn't the only one to blame, because technically this could've been all avoided if N.A.T.O. didn't offer membership to Ukraine. Russia has been very generous by letting other former SR's into N.A.T.O. especially the baltic states. This was the only way the Kremlin could've responded since the relations wiht Ukraine were damaged by the 2014 Ukranian Revolution. It is indeed terrible to see people suffering from all of this just because someone wants more, wether it's the Kremlin, N.A.T.O., the U.S. or anyone else.There are many ways to look at this conflict and it's origins and, consequently, many different people to blame.

"One thing that is important to consider is that Ukraine's present borders do not represent what it was before World War II.  Crimea then was part of the Russian Republic and Transcarpathian Region was part of Czechoslovakia.  Many regions north of Transcarpathia were part of Poland. After the break up of Soviet Union, several regions held referendums to break away from Ukraine (for example Dec 1991 referendum in Transcarpathian Region), but the Ukrainian government chose to ignore it. Ukrainian nationalism is a nasty force in Ukrainian politics.  That being said, while I agree with the annexation of Crimea and that the Ukrainian border needs to be redrawn, military invasion by Putin or any form of war is not the way.  This all should have been resolved peacefully.  UN peacekeepers should have stepped into the region a long time ago, instead of NATO meddling antagonizing Russia.",3,0

"Respectful Vox, you do need to work out some factual errors here, the most important of them being that Ukraine was actually the last to get out of the USSR as people felt good there and had no intention to leave. As a matter of fact, there was a referendum in 1991. ""The question put to voters was - Do you consider necessary the preservation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a renewed federation of equal sovereign republics in which the rights and freedom of an individual of any ethnicity will be fully guaranteed? The referendum's question was approved by nearly 80% of voters in all nine other republics that took part except for Armenia, Estonia, Georgia  (though not the breakaway province of Abkhazia, where the result was over 98% in favor, and in South Ossetia), Latvia, Lithuania, and Moldova (though not Transnistria or Gagauzia), turnout was 80% across the rest of the Soviet Union. However, August Coup prevented the formation of the renewed federation, causing the Soviet Union to be dissolved on 26 December 1991 with Ukraine being the last. Voilà!",15,0

Clearly, Russia- although being culturally closer to these countries - doesn‘t have the economic strength, to be be attraktive enough for these particular countries.
But please, do not insult mankind‘s intelligence by pretending that it‘s about democracy, equality and freedom! First and foremost these countries are among the most racist, corrupt and violent countries  in the world - no, certainly not just in Europe - in the world!
Just spend some time there, like I unfortunately did - but only if you‘re not black, indian, muslim…! Go there if you‘re white and christian- in this case you won‘t see the racism in those mentioned eastern-european countries, yet you‘ll at least whitness coruption and unequality.
And Russia isn‘t better… 
It’s harsh to think or believe it, but when you’re there you start asking yourself, if it is possible that racism is just part of the slavic culture? Because you whitness it literally every day!

"В Крыму вообще-то был референдум из-за притеснений, в Киеве стал возрождаться нацизм, что не оценили жители, ЛНР и ДНР, а за неделю до операции, Украина решила начинать запасаться ядерным оружием, параллельно понося Россию на всех каналах, настраивая неискушенный народ на врожденную русофобию. Почему это рассказано нейтрально с преобладанием западного видения с другой стороны земного шара. Помимо своих СМИ перед такими видео, стоило бы посмотреть СМИ Крыма, ЛНР, ДНР и России. Так бы хоть реальная нейтральность и независимость мнений бы вышла. А тут собрали всю Американскую прессу, и свалили в кучу.

In fact, there was a referendum in Crimea because of harassment, Nazism began to revive in Kyiv, which was not appreciated by the inhabitants, the LNR and the DNR, and a week before the operation, Ukraine decided to start stocking up on nuclear weapons, while simultaneously vilifying Russia on all channels, setting up an inexperienced people to innate Russophobia. Why is it narrated in a neutrally Western-dominated way from the other side of the globe. In addition to your own media before such videos, it would be worth to you watching the media of Crimea, the LPR, the DPR and Russia. So at least real neutrality and independence of opinion would come out. But you gathered all the American press, and piled it into a heap.

Few years ago,  huge amounts of potential natural resources ( Oil and Gas) were found in Ukraine, in the south-western part of the Region and around Crimea. If Ukraine were to join NATO, and fully ally themselves with EU both politically and economically, this would mean that Russia's exportation of both gas & oil to Europe would not longer be neccesary, since Ukraine would fill the demand.  Take into consideration that almost 50% of Russia's GDP is solely the exportation of these 2 resources.  

The more they destabilize Ukraine, the longer it will take them to build the neccesary equipment & Factories to extract the natural resources. Moreover, petrol-related companies like Shell, will no longer want to continue helping the country build its infrastucture. (Shell terminated their builds during Crimea Attacks)",0,0

"This is a good primer on the basic string of events and settings leading to the invasion. However, this perspective is all too neutral and sterile. Ukraine’s as yet untapped natural gas deposits and its threat to Russia’s own already established petro industry are fundamental reasons for this invasion. Putin invaded Crimea first because of this very reason. If he really wanted to “liberate” and “recognize the independence” of the separatist terrorists, then he should have fought for their land first.

(I do not support the invasion) A big overlooked reason for Russia to invade Ukraine is the massive investment from the west into newly discovered oil and natural Gas in Ukraine which will be devastating to Russia's economy as it's reliant on selling these resources. So these sanctions are not effective as a deterrence since in the long run the Russian economy will be hit very hard as well. While if they secure these resources they will be one of the if not the biggest oil/gas supplier to europe and china. After they annexed Crimea they already took control of 80% of Ukraine's newly discovered offshore oil drilling sites in their exclusive economic zone and simultaniously made western petrol companies halt their investments due fear of risks,1,0

Clearly, any sane person would want SECURITY GUARANTEES that Moscow won't attack them if they disagree with it. The BEST guarantee is NATO. USSR never dared to challenge NATO, that same fear is inherited by RUSSIA.

It's like if Mexico signed a military pact with North Korea. The US would not stand for it.

Poor video Vox. It’s about the oil. It’s always about the oil. Russia is a Petro state that gets most of it gdp from oil and gas. And that’s where it gets it’s power. Oil discoveries in the Black Sea and gas on land give Ukraine the opportunity to become a wealthy petro state. But they don’t have the expertise to develop these fields and become wealthy. That’s where the west comes in. By annexing crimea with a bogus election he took these waters. Same reason he is going after Kharkiv. That’s where the gas is. If the west can get gas from Ukraine they don’t need Russia and they cannot find their military. Ukraine also destroyed a canal supplying water to crimea and Russia is bleeding money trying to stop the place from turning into a ghost state. This video does nothing to explain the reason for the war.,0,0
